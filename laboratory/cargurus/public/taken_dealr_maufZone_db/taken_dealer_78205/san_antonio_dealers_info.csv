D-24787021,Lings Auto Corp,N/A,1510 Hoefgen Ave,San Antonio,TX,"San Antonio, TX",N/A,78210,"Called and talked with Frank.  I asked if he personally drove the car because his dealership was 3.5 hours away. He assured me the car drove great and I would like it.  He lied.  Shocks/struts were awful.  At 70 mph the front feft of the car was bouncing so bad I got off the freeway.  It scared the crap out of me.  The car interior was also really bad.  I guess that is why there were so few pics of the interior.  Leather seats had small cracks throughout.  With a repair center on site, the oil was even dirty.  Undercarriage was not adhered correctly on the front.  All the 5 Star reviews must be from friends or people that were paid.  Also, BEWARE  this place is in a very bad neighborhood.",https://static1.cargurus.com/gfx/dealersnearme/dealer_logo_placeholder.png,public/uploads/dealer\Lings-Auto-Corp_San Antonio_TX.jpg,2 mi,4.5,8,https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/m-Lings-Auto-Corp-sp409157,1,1

confirm I was still interested in purchasing the vehicle. He called me 
the next day with approval for a loan. Within 2 days I was at the 
dealership test driving the vehicle and ultimately buying it.
Barry helped me with all the paperwork and even though there was an 
issue with my insurance he was finding ways to help me out so that I 
could buy the vehicle. He was very nice and knowledgeable. The last 
time I bought a vehicle I left feeling like I was ripped off and that the 
salesman only cared about getting his money. When I left Drive Out 
Auto Center I felt the complete opposite. I would highly recommend 
Drive Out Auto Center to anybody looking to purchase their next

was the ""cash"" and the actual price was almost 2k 
higher then it was being advertised for.

that I was very serious and committed to working 
out a deal, only to be told that ""I'd think about it"" 
with a promised return call on the following Monday 
(it was Saturday at the time).

Never received a follow up call, or responses to any

The sales person knew I had reservations. I said as long as you can get me out in time for my reservation. I sat down filled out some paperwork work to make my offer and then sat there for 15 minutes waiting for another person to come over and tell me they won’t consider my offer at all until I can sit down and complete the deal if they accepted the offer. I guess I can understand that but why not tell me that instead of waisting my time. I went to lunch came back and made the same offer only to have them promptly come back and say it wasn’t enough. They could have said that the first time when I said I didn’t want to negotiate and my offer price is what I’m willing to pay.

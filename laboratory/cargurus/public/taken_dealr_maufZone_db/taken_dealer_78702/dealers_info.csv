Days after everything was done I was contacted about my drivers license needing to be scanned.  Keep in mind they had a copy and scanned when I signed final documents.  Does this mean my drivers license scan/copy was lost?  WTF.  I expect a little more professionalism from larger dealerships.  Sadly they are lacking here.

- a genuinely good man.

Also, his team maintains and details their cars beyond anything I've seen on high-miles cars. The one I bought from him looked and smelled like it 
just left the dealership brand new.

Very good credit score! We were shocked about their % offer and had to walk out there!
I guess Austin people believe them and falling for their super high interest rate financing! They also adding so much extras which is like $10K on top of the listed CarGurus price.
Sorry but we don’t need to buy a car here!!!!

Went straight to our hometown which has also a Nissan dealer and bought the same day a Kicks with a much lower interest rate.

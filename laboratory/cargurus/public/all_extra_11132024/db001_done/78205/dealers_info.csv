D-24787021,Lings Auto Corp,N/A,1510 Hoefgen Ave,San Antonio,TX,"San Antonio, TX",N/A,78210,"Called and talked with Frank.  I asked if he personally drove the car because his dealership was 3.5 hours away. He assured me the car drove great and I would like it.  He lied.  Shocks/struts were awful.  At 70 mph the front feft of the car was bouncing so bad I got off the freeway.  It scared the crap out of me.  The car interior was also really bad.  I guess that is why there were so few pics of the interior.  Leather seats had small cracks throughout.  With a repair center on site, the oil was even dirty.  Undercarriage was not adhered correctly on the front.  All the 5 Star reviews must be from friends or people that were paid.  Also, BEWARE  this place is in a very bad neighborhood.",https://static1.cargurus.com/gfx/dealersnearme/dealer_logo_placeholder.png,2 mi,4.5,8,https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/m-Lings-Auto-Corp-sp409157

D-24787024,Drive Out Auto Center,N/A,3223 San Pedro Ave,San Antonio,TX,"San Antonio, TX",N/A,78212,"Applying online was quick and easy. Matt called me within minutes to 
confirm I was still interested in purchasing the vehicle. He called me 
the next day with approval for a loan. Within 2 days I was at the 
dealership test driving the vehicle and ultimately buying it.
Barry helped me with all the paperwork and even though there was an 
issue with my insurance he was finding ways to help me out so that I 
could buy the vehicle. He was very nice and knowledgeable. The last 
time I bought a vehicle I left feeling like I was ripped off and that the 
salesman only cared about getting his money. When I left Drive Out 
Auto Center I felt the complete opposite. I would highly recommend 
Drive Out Auto Center to anybody looking to purchase their next 
vehicle.",https://static.cargurus.com/images/site/2019/03/12/11/54/drive_out_auto_center-pic-3071783752722894971-200x200.jpeg,3 mi,4.7,9,https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/m-Drive-Out-Auto-Center-sp349655

written down while we were haggling over the price was revoked. The manager 
stated the sales person made a mistake and that they couldnât sell the car for that 
price. May have been an honest mistake but be warned as itâs either inexperienced 
sales people or bad management. I lean towards the later given that another 
customer came in and was told the car they came to look at was sold. The sales 
reps response was, âI know we called you 30m ago, but these things happenâ.",https://static.cargurus.com/images/site/2022/07/12/09/58/clay_cooley_hyundai_of_dallas-pic-1229696001763261020-200x200.jpeg,5 mi,3.2,4,https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/m-Clay-Cooley-Hyundai-of-Dallas-sp281332

I told him no I wanted that one. He said he'll check if he could find one just like it. 20 min later he didn't. He tried to get us to look at new cars but we refused. He said let him try to find us something similar in there loaners and he'll be right back. At that point I left. I should of read the reviews. Because it apparently happens often.

wife test drive the vehicle we wanted by themselves. After we decided we wanted the Lexus, I 
asked him for a better drive out price. He came in lower that what I asked him for. He held the 
car for me till the next day. I asked him for a full tank of gas and a wash and wax and he 
agreed. Ali got a very nice wax job on it. I bought a Carfax report on my own. The car was 
very low mileage for its age and in VERY good shape. Carfax's suggested price was $45% 
higher than what I paid + TTL. He doesn't have control on TTL. 
I highly recommend Ali and his dealership. The lot is not signed well but it was an overall 
excellent experience. We got a much better price than a dealership with high overhead would

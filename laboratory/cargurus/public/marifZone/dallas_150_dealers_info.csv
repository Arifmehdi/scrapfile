relaxation of test driving on your own. This is a true change of pace, compared to having a dealer breath down your neck, or being parasitic. However, 
this is where the good experience ends. Upon moving forward you will learn that they do not move on asking price because the price you see online is 
their best and final. On top of that they add on MADITORY $3K worth of ""used car protection"" and new $700 mats?! You will think, ""well surely I can have 
them remove these items"" Fight tooth and nail and you only get HALF OFF for that s#*t. Their own websites says and I quote Mr. CLAY himself! ""We 
never charge our customers for Dealer Adds, Market Adjustments, or hidden fees. The price that you see online is the price that you pay for your new or

enough but aren't they all when they want you to buy.

He could not produce a reconditioning report yet claimed it was up to date and they don't report to CarFax which is a red flag.
A car's condition is based on verifiable mechanical and cosmetic condition; it's not what they say it is. Oldest sales tactic there 
is.

According to the CarFax and maintenance booklet I cross referenced, there are many discrepancies. I ran the car with options at 
Edmunds and it was estimated with average condition at $15,585 factoring in options, accident history, condition, and 
maintenance due. Moe then insults me of not being able to afford the car. Nonsense. It's about overpaying.
